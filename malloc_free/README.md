# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## Description

This project focuses on **dynamic memory allocation** in C using `malloc` and `free`. It covers the basic principles, usage patterns, and good practices when handling memory manually in C. The goal is to understand how to allocate memory during runtime, how to release it properly, and how to check for memory leaks using tools like Valgrind.
